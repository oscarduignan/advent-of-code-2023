# Advent of Code 2023

Not sure how much I'll do with the amount of other stuff I have on my plate at the moment - never seem to make it to double digits

Run with [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)

And recommend writing new solutions in [Worksheets](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/tools-worksheets.html) so you don't have to litter `println()` everywhere

## Day 1
This was challenging because of the approach I took at first, a few examples were missing that are needed to understand the full behaviour. For example "fiveight" needs to be read as 58.

```shell
scala-cli day01.sc
